     <h1>Double Bag Static Line</h1>

       <h2>What was this course?</h2>
        <p>"Double Bag Static Line" refers to a configuration of a parachute system.  This is a free fall chute that gets packed into an extra bag connected to a static line.  This is beneficial for team inserts because the static line system allows everyone's chute to deploy at roughly the same altitude.</p>
        <p>My team and I went to this course to learn how to pack, jump, and pilot this rig configuration.  One more skillset to add to the repertoire.</p>
        <p>Also in this course we learned how to rig and jump full loads of equipment to make this a practical skill that we could actually use to do our jobs.</p>
        <h2>Reason for Attending</h2>
        <p>Where the Army's Basic Airborne Course teaches you the basics of parachuting and landing, you are only taught how to do low-level jumps which are not actually practical in a combat environment.  Jumping at low altitudes exposes the aircraft to enemy fire and observation, as well as alerts everyone to the fact that you are parachuting in.</p>
        <p>This course teaches the use of a free-fall ram-air chute which allows for jumps at higher altitudes.  The chute also has a higher glide ratio (meaning you move forwward faster than you fall under canopy) which allows the plane to drop you off further away from enemy lines.</p>
        <h2>Course Details</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Location:</dt>
            <dd>Parker, AZ.<br>The course was put on by a USMC Mobile Training Team (MTT) at the facilities owned by IDIS Corp. (<a href="idis.html">see IDIS page</a>) so that we could seamlessly finish the DBSL course and begin the IDIS course.</dd>
            <dt>Length:</dt>
            <dd>Approx. 2 weeks</dd>
            <dt>Jumps:</dt>
            <dd>13 jumps, all at 6,500 ft. msl</dd>

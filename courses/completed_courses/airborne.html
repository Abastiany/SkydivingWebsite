     <h1>Basic Airborne Course</h1>
      <section>

       <h2>What was this course?</h2>
          <p>The U.S. Army's Basic Airborne Course teaches students the basics of low-level static line jumping.  In order to do any sort of parachuting in the military, you must first attend this course.</p>
          <p>The course consists of three weeks: Ground Week, Tower Week, and Jump Week.</p>
          <p>In the first week, you learn basic parachuting knowledge, gear rigging, on-board aircraft procedures, and the essential skill of landing correctly.  Incorrect landings cause many injuries every course.</p>
          <p>During the second week, you learn proper exit techniques as well as basic canopy piloting and emergency procedures.</p>
          <p>The final week consists of five actual jumps from an aircraft.  The jumps at BAC are "static line" jumps, which means your parachute is attached to a line which gets hooked into the plane.  As you jump, the line pulls the chute out of your pack so that you don't have to deploy it yourself.  The jumps are all done at 12,500 ft. and are just enough to get you past the initial fear and familiarize you with the feeling of jumping, parachute flight, and landing.</p>
          <p>For more information on this course, visit the BAC page on the U.S. Army's website <a href="https://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/artb/1-507th/Airborne/index.html">here</a></p>
        <h2>Reason for Attending</h2>
        <p>To be an effective part of a team, you have to have insert capabilities.  The three basic paths of insertion for military operations are Ground, Air, and Water.  All members of a team should be individually proficient at as many insert methods as possible so as to not be a liability or limiting factor to an operation.</p>
        <p>Airborne school is the start of any military jumper's career in the air.  Here is where you will learn the basics of airborne operations so that you can attend follow-on schools to further advance your proficiency and skillset.</p>

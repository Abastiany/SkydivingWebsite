       <h2>What was this course?</h2>
          <p>"IDIS" is a Germanic term for the Norse "Valkyrie", which were winged godesses or warriors who would decide who lived or died in battle.  The <a href="https://www.idis-corp.com">IDIS corporation</a> is a company founded and run by ex-military and government individuals who have experience in the field of special operations and airborne missions.  IDIS corporation offers training to various military and paramilitary groups on advanced team airborne infiltration.</p>
        <p>My team attended this course immediately after <a href="dbsl.html">DBSL</a> to learn how to properly insert as a team using the parachuting skills we learned there.</p>
        <p>Jumping at high altitudes comes with many added stressors, such as temperatures, weather, and oxygen.  We learned how to navigate all of these aspects and more.  At our highest jump, we had to pre-breathe on pure oxygen for half an hour above 20,000 ft. and then we would jump with smaller oxygen tanks to last us the drop.  At 25,000 ft, it was around -40deg. Fahrenheit, while on the ground it was above 110deg.  You had to dress in order to not sweat while on the ground, and deal with an "acceptable level of cold and discomfort" because any sweat or moisture would instantly turn to frostbite upon stepping off of the ramp.</p>
        <p>This course also certified us to jump with night vision optics.  Jumping with night vision provides many obvious benefits for real-world missions, but at the same time poses extra difficulties and risks for the individual.</p>
        <h2>Reason for Attending</h2>
        <p>Once we were individually comfortable jumping at higher altitudes with the new parachute systems - taught in DBSL, we went through the IDIS infiltration course in order to build skills as a team.  Here we learned the intricacies of team flying and and inserting into unknown territory.</p>
        <p>The jumps we did in this course were at even higher altitudes (up to 25,000 ft.) to allow for further plane offsets.  This means the plane would drop us off miles and miles away and we would float in silently under cover of darkness to our objectives.  At times, we were under canopy for as much as 45 minutes.</p>
